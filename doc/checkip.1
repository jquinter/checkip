.SH CONFIG FILE
Checkip will create $HOME/.config/checkip.conf the first time it is invoked. Users must define the variables therein prior to invoking the script. The file is well commented and self-explanatory.

Invoking the script via a crontab is the recommended way to insure that any changes to the external IP are reported to the target email address. Below is an example invoking the script once, every 4 hours:
